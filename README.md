My name is Caroline Uys and I am a senior at Charlotte Latin School. I am currently 17 years old and I hope to study biomedical engineering in college. My interest in BME was sparked by my love for biology and engineering during my junior year in highschool. I am also really interested in neuroscience and neuroengineering because I think the brain is a field that lacks a lot of information. My year-long project for this class is a joint effort with other people in my class to help design and improve assistive technology devices for the patients in the Atrium Carolina's Rehabilitation Center (The Pearl) and can be found at this link: https://github.com/26wickhm/pearl

The very first project we worked on in senior engineering was the tradition of creating our own pens to keep and use. Throughout this process I learned how to use many of the woodworking machines like the saw, drill press, and lathe. The project took about a week to complete in total. Preparing the wood included picking out what wood I wanted to use, gluing the pieces together to dry overnight, cutting them down to size, and sanding down the corners for a smoother shaping experience. After that I drilled through the pieces using the drill press and shaped them down with a flat edge chisel and then a rounded chisel. The final touches were to put varnish on the pen and assemble all of the pieces. During this project, I thankfully did not run into any problems and everything went smoothly. Below is the completed project and some documentation of the steps I took along the way:

THe second project we have done in-class was a small soldering refresher with a touch-interactive owl kit. The only problem I ran into during this project was that some of the soldering connections were not always sticking to the pads, especially the ones for the usb-c port. To correct this issue I made sure to take my time with the soldering and add extra solder where it was needed. Below are pictures documenting my progress throughout doing the soldering kit and the final product:
