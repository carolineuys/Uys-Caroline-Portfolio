My name is Caroline Uys and I am a senior at Charlotte Latin School. I am currently 17 years old and I hope to study biomedical engineering in college. My interest in BME was sparked by my love for biology and engineering during my junior year in highschool. I am also really interested in neuroscience and neuroengineering because I think the brain is a field that lacks a lot of information. 

The very first project we worked on in senior engineering was the tradition of creating our own pens to keep and use. Throughout this process I learned how to use many of the woodworking machines like the saw, drill press, and lathe. The project took about a week to complete in total. Preparing the wood included picking out what wood I wanted to use, gluing the pieces together to dry overnight, cutting them down to size, and sanding down the corners for a smoother shaping experience. After that I drilled through the pieces using the drill press and shaped them down with a flat edge chisel and then a rounded chisel. The final touches were to put varnish on the pen and assemble all of the pieces. Below is the completed project and some documentation of the steps I took along the way:
